# Our Solution

Keypom allows for the creation of highly customizable access keys. These keys can be thought of as having their
own *smart contracts*. Each access key derives from what's known as a *drop*. These drops outline the different 
functionalities and behaviors the key will have. A drop can be thought of as a bucket that access keys belong to.
You can create many different buckets and fill them each with their own keys. Each key will act in accordance to the
drop, or bucket, it belongs to.

A drop can be one of four different types:

1. Simple drop.
2. Non Fungible Token drop.
3. Fungible Token drop.
4. Function Call drop.
