# Creating a Drop

Let's create your first drops! In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create all 4 kinds of drops: Simple, NFT, FT, and Function Call drops.  

The code snippets will reflect the three ways you can interact with Keypom using code:
1. [NEAR Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://docs.near.org/tools/near-cli) 
2. [NEAR API-JS](https://docs.near.org/tools/near-api-js/quick-reference#)
3. Keypom-JS SDK

In these tutorials, we will be primarily using NEAR's testnet network.
