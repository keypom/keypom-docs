# Cookbook - Balances
Welcome to the Keypom cookbook! Here you can explore Keypom's building blocks that help create awesome onboarding experiences.

## Getting Started
In this cookbook, you will get to explore different building blocks you can use for your own projects. These will range from creating a drop to working with Keypom balances and everything in between. Each of these building blocks will provide a code snippet, using the Keypom JS SDK and Rust.

For the cookbook, you will need the following installed. 
1. [Node JS](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)  
2. [Keypom JS SDK](https://github.com/keypom/keypom-js#getting-started)
3. *Insert rust one here, i actually have no idea how to do that*


## Connection to NEAR and Initializing the SDK
When working with the SDK, you will always need to connect to NEAR and initiate Keypom using the `initKeypom` function. This will always be the first function you call to interact with the SDK. 

`initKeypom` initializes the SDK to allow for interactions with the Keypom smart contracts. Without it, none of the other SDK functions would work as expected. If a NEAR connection is not already present, it will initialize a new one for you. More info on the `initKeypom` function can be found [here](../../keypom-sdk/Core/modules.md#initkeypom).
