# Preface -> put this pre-reqs on getting started

Throughout this tutorial, we will be showing how to create [the four types](/Concepts/Keypom%20Protocol/Github%20Readme/Types%20of%20Drops/introduction.md) of Keypom drops. We will be doing this using two methods.

1) [NEAR-API-JS](https://docs.near.org/tools/near-api-js/reference)  
2) Keypom-JS SDK <-- 

It will be assumed that you already have NEAR-API-JS [installed](https://docs.near.org/tools/near-api-js/quick-reference#install).

## Installing Keypom-JS SDK
To install, simply run the following in your command prompt.
```bash
npm -i keypom-js
```
