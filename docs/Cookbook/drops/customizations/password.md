# Password Protection
This part of the cookbook contains everything related password protecting your drops.
## Getting Started
For the cookbook, you will need the following installed. 
1. [Node JS](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)  
2. [Keypom JS SDK](https://github.com/keypom/keypom-js#getting-started)


:::info note
These scripts will not run without the proper setup shown in the [introduction page](../../welcome.md#connection-to-near-and-initializing-the-sdk).

## Password Protecting your Entire Drop
Password protecting your drop prevents unauthorized people from claiming keys in your drop. A claim will fail if the password is not included in the claim transaction.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="SDK" label="Keypom JS SDKðŸ§©">

```js
// Create drop with 10 password protected keys and 2 key uses each
let {keys, dropId} = await createDrop({
    account: fundingAccount,
    numKeys: 1,
    depositPerUseNEAR: "0.1",
    basePassword: "base-password"
})

console.log(keys)
```

## Password Protecting a Specific Key Use
Rather than password protecting your entire drop, you may only want to protect certain key uses. A great use case of this is for [ticketing](../../../Tutorials/Advanced/ticketing/architecture.md#attendance-required-for-poap), when a bouncer would scan your ticket to claim your key and admit you into the event but only they know the password. This would prevent people admitting themselves into the event and gaining access to any POAPs and goodies available only to those who physically attend. 

To specify key uses to password protect, simply add it to the `passwordProtectedUses` array. 

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="SDK" label="Keypom JS SDKðŸ§©">

```js
// Create drop with 10 password protected keys and 5 key uses each
let {keys, dropId} = await createDrop({
    account: fundingAccount,
    numKeys: 10,
    config:{
		usesPerKey: 5
	},
    depositPerUseNEAR: "0.1",
    basePassword: "base-password"
    // Password protect the first, third and fourth key uses
    passwordProtectedUses: [1, 3, 4],
})

console.log(keys)
```

## Delete Drop
A drop can be deleted manually at any time using `deleteDrops`. This will refund all unclaimed key balances back to the drop funder's Keypom balance. 

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="SDK" label="Keypom JS SDKðŸ§©">

```js
// Get drops for user
let drops = await getDrops({accountId: "minqi.testnet"});

// Delete the first two by drop object
await deleteDrops({
    drops: [drops[0], drops[1]]
})

// Delete the next two by dropId
await deleteDrops({
    dropIds: [drops[2].drop_id, drops[3].drop_id]
})
```

</TabItem>
