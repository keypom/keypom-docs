# Function Call Drops
This part of the cookbook contains everything related to drops, including creating a drop, password protecting it, and utilizing Keypom arguments.
## Getting Started
For the cookbook, you will need the following installed. 
1. [Node JS](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)  
2. [Keypom JS SDK](https://github.com/keypom/keypom-js#getting-started)
3. *Insert rust one here, i actually have no idea how to do that*

:::info note
Ensure that you have initialized Keypom using the `initKeypom` funciton prior to running any of the SDK examples. For more info on this, see the [introduction page](../welcome.md#connection-to-near-and-initializing-the-sdk)

### Creating a Function Call Drop
A drop is the fundemental building block of Keypom. It is a collection of access keys that all share the same properties.

```js
// Creating a single key single use FC drop
let {keys, dropId} = await createDrop({
    account: fundingAccount,
    numKeys: 1,
    config: {
        usesPerKey: 1
    },
    depositPerUseNEAR: "0.1",
    fcData: {
        methods: [
            [
                {
                    receiverId: MY_CONTRACT,
                    methodName: "mint",
                    args: JSON.stringify({
                        memo: "Called from Keypom FC drop!"
                        metadata: {
                            id: 4390000
                        }
                    }),
                }
            ],
        ]   
    }   
})

console.log(keys)
```

### Keypom Args
Keypom Args are important pieces of information injected automatically by Keypom when a key is claimed. If any attempt is made to spoof Keypom args, the claim will automatically fail. This makes the Keypom Args an untamperable source of truth. The pieces of information can include: 
- Drop ID that the access key belongs to
- Funder's `accountId` of the drop
- The claiming account's `accountId`
- The current access key's `keyId`

The information are injected into the `args`, but their specific location depends on the field specified. Here, the `funderId` is being injected into an `originalOwner` field in the args, and the claiming account's `accountId` is being injected into the metadata object under the field `newOwner`.

// Creating FC drop that injects accountId into function call arguments

### Delete Drop
A drop can be deleted manually at any time using `deleteDrops`. This will refund all unclaimed key balances back to the drop funder's Keypom balance. 

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="SDK" label="Keypom JS SDKðŸ§©">

```js
// Get drops for user
let drops = await getDrops({accountId: "minqi.testnet"});

// Delete the first two by drop object
await deleteDrops({
    drops: [drops[0], drops[1]]
})

// Delete the next two by dropId
await deleteDrops({
    dropIds: [drops[2].drop_id, drops[3].drop_id]
})
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Rust" label="RustðŸ¦€">
