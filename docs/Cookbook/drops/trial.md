# Trial Account Drops
This part of the cookbook contains a quick overview on how to create a trial account drop.
## Getting Started
For the cookbook, you will need the following installed. 
1. [Node JS](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)  
2. [Keypom JS SDK](https://github.com/keypom/keypom-js#getting-started)


:::info note
These scripts will not run without the proper setup shown in the [introduction page](../welcome.md#connection-to-near-and-initializing-the-sdk).

## Creating a Trial Account Drop
When creating a trial account drop, there are 3 main parameters to define. The first is `callableContracts`, indicating what contracts the trial account can call. This will prevent rugging from the funder's perspective. Next is `maxAttachableNearPerContract` which just outlines how much $NEAR can be attached to any function call on any of the aforementioned contracts. The order of this is the same as the order defined in `callableContracts`. Lastly is the `callableMethods` parameter, which defines what methods the trial account is allowed to call on the allowed contracts. A `*` indicated any contract is callable. 

When creating the drop, the trial account's balance is then defined by its starting balance and ending balance, known as the `startingBalanceNEAR` and `trialEndFloorNEAR` respectively.

At its core, a trial account drop is just a FunctionCall drop that uses the function calls to creates an account with a contract deployed to it, and then calls the `setup` method on that newly created account. Since there is no `createTrialAccountDrop` equivalent baked into the protocol, you will need to manually setup all the FC drop arguments.

The first half, creating an account with a contract deployed to it, is done using the [`create_account_advanced`](https://github.com/near/near-linkdrop/blob/49279e529c254fa7736465b4a39d05cb8f1e5443/src/lib.rs#L156) method. If you have used a custom drop root using the [`root_account_id`](../../keypom-sdk/Core/interfaces/ProtocolReturnedDropConfig.md#root_account_id) parameter, you must ensure the contract deployed to that account has the `create_account_advanced` method exposed. 

A sample set of arguments passed into `create_account_advanced` for a trial account drop can be found [here](https://github.com/keypom/keypom-js/blob/5e4c7f3524c9e2b5be537a779e3ebf41bcafc357/packages/core/src/lib/trial-accounts/pre-trial.ts#L319-L333).

The second half is the `setup` method, which defines the trial account's allowed contracts, methods and max deposits etc. It's important to understand that the `setup` method is being called on the contract deployed to the trial account during `create_account_advanced`. To do this, the `receiver_to_claimer` must be set to `true`.

A sample set of arguments passed into `setup` can be found [here](https://github.com/keypom/keypom-js/blob/5e4c7f3524c9e2b5be537a779e3ebf41bcafc357/packages/core/src/lib/trial-accounts/pre-trial.ts#L341-L351).

## Delete Drop
A drop can be deleted manually at any time using `deleteDrops`. This will refund all unclaimed key balances back to the drop funder's Keypom balance. 

The Keypom contract does not have a `deleteDrops` equivalent function. Behind the scenes of the SDK, the keys are being collected, refunded and then deleted. 

The first step in this process is to use `get_key_supply_for_drop`. Once the total key supply is found, 50 keys at a time are retrieved using `get_keys_for_drop` and refunding their associated assets and deleting the keys using `refund_assets` and `delete_keys` respectively.
