# Sale Configurations
This part of the cookbook contains everything related to drops, including creating a drop, password protecting it, and utilizing Keypom arguments.
## Getting Started
For the cookbook, you will need the following installed. 
1. [Node JS](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)  
2. [Keypom JS SDK](https://github.com/keypom/keypom-js#getting-started)


:::info note
These scripts will not run without the proper setup shown in the [introduction page](../../welcome.md#connection-to-near-and-initializing-the-sdk).

## Public Sale Drop
A public sale drop is one where you can sell the access keys from a drop to other users. These keys will all have the same properties and can be bought by anyone. The maximum number of keys in the drop can be set using `maxNumKeys`. 

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="SDK" label="ðŸ”‘ Keypom SDK">

```js
// Create drop with a maximum of 10 keys that can be added by anyone
const { keys, dropId } = await createDrop({
    account: fundingAccount,
    depositPerUseNEAR: 0.1,
    config: {
        sale: {
            maxNumKeys: 10,
            pricePerKeyNEAR: 1
        }
    }
});

console.log(keys)
```

</TabItem>

## Allowing Only Certain Users to Buy Keys
A public sale drop can be turned into a more private sale by only allowing certain accounts to purchase keys from the drop. This is done by using the `allowlist` argument. Any `accountId` specified here will be able to buy keys from your drop. If someone not on the list tries to buy from your drop, they will be rejected. 

By default, if no `allowlist` is included, then anybody can purchase a key.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="SDK" label="ðŸ”‘ Keypom SDK">

```js
// Create drop with a maximum of 10 keys that can be added by benji and min
const { keys, dropId } = await createDrop({
    account: fundingAccount,
    depositPerUseNEAR: 0.1,
    config: {
        sale: {
            maxNumKeys: 10,
            pricePerKeyNEAR: 1
            allowlist: ["benji.testnet", "minqi.testnet"]
        }
    }
});

console.log(keys)
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Blocking People from a Public Sale
To protect your public sale, you may also choose to block certain accounts from purchasing keys. This can be done by using the `blocklist` argument. This prohibits select accounts from purchasing keys from your drop. 

:::note
here that since no `allowlist` is specified, anybody can purchase keys. However, since `evil-moon.testnet` is on the blocklist, they will not be allowed to do so. This means that everybody except for `evil-moon.testnet` has permission to purchase a key. 
:::

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="SDK" label="ðŸ”‘ Keypom SDK">

```js
// Create drop with a maximum of 10 keys that can be added anyone but evil-moon
const { keys, dropId } = await createDrop({
    account: fundingAccount,
    depositPerUseNEAR: 0.1,
    config: {
        sale: {
            maxNumKeys: 10,
            pricePerKeyNEAR: 1
            blocklist: ["evil-moon.testnet"]
        }
    }
});

console.log(keys)
```

</TabItem>

## Buying Keys from a Public Sale
If you are allowed to buy tickets from a public sale, you can simply create a new key and call `addKeys` on the public sale drop with the ticket price attached to the `extraDepositNEAR` argument.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="SDK" label="ðŸ”‘ Keypom SDK">

```js
// 10 $NEAR ticket price
const TICKET_PRICE = "10"
// Desired sale's dropId
const SALE_DROP_ID = "1684876169052"

// Generate a random key
const {publicKeys} = await generateKeys({
    numKeys: 1
});

await addKeys({
    account: fundingAccount,
    publicKeys,
    dropId: SALE_DROP_ID,
    extraDepositNEAR: TICKET_PRICE
})
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::note
In its the example above, anybody can buy as many tickets as they'd like within the limits of the drop. For further customization, you could build a "public sale bot" contract. 

This contract would act as an entry point that users interface with and buy tickets from; allowing you to restrict the number of tickets and add further customization. To facilitate this, you would need to [create an `allowlist`](#allowing-only-certain-users-to-buy-keys) containing the bot contract.

## Modifying Sale `allowlist`
After your public sale drop has been created, you can modify the `allowlist` by adding or removing users from it using `addToSaleAllowlist` and `removeFromSaleAllowlist`. 

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="SDK" label="ðŸ”‘ Keypom SDK">

```js
const {dropId} = await createDrop({
    numKeys: 0,
    depositPerUseNEAR: 0.1,
    config: {
        sale: {
            maxNumKeys: 2,
            pricePerKeyNEAR: 1,
            allowlist: ["evil-moon.testnet"]
        }
    }
});

// Remove evil-moon from allowlist
await removeFromSaleAllowlist({
    account: fundingAccount, 
    dropId, 
    accountIds: ["evil-moon.testnet"]
});

// Add benji and minqi to allowlist
await addToSaleAllowlist({
    account: fundingAccount, 
    dropId, 
    accountIds: ["benji.testnet", "minqi.testnet"]
});
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Modifying Sale `blocklist`
After your public sale drop has been created, you can modify the `blocklist` by adding or removing users from it using `addToSaleBlocklist` and `removeFromSaleBlocklist`. 

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="SDK" label="ðŸ”‘ Keypom SDK">

```js
const {dropId} = await createDrop({
    numKeys: 0,
    depositPerUseNEAR: 0.1,
    config: {
        sale: {
            maxNumKeys: 2,
            pricePerKeyNEAR: 1,
            blocklist: ["minqi.testnet", "benji.testnet"]
        }
    }
});

// Remove evil-moon benji and minqi from blocklist
await removeFromSaleBlocklist({
    account: fundingAccount, 
    dropId, 
    accountIds: ["benji.testnet", "minqi.testnet"]
});

// Add evil-moon to blocklist
await addToSaleBlocklist({
    account: fundingAccount, 
    dropId, 
    accountIds: ["evil-moon.testnet"]
});
```

</TabItem>
