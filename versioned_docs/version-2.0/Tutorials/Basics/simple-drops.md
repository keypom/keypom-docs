# Simple Drop

## Introduction
In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a simple $NEAR drop from scratch. By embedding $NEAR in a Web2 style link, the simple drop allows you to onboard both existing and new users. 

Being the simplest Keypom drop type, it acts as the foundation for the other 3 kinds of Keypom drops. Despite this, the simple drop opens the door to more complex use cases such as [subscription services](../../Tutorials/Advanced/subscriptions/introduction.md).

---

## Prerequisites
For the basic tutorials, you can choose to run the scripts on your own machine. To do so, you must have the following:

1. [Node JS](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)  
2. [NEAR-API-JS](https://docs.near.org/tools/near-api-js/quick-reference#install)  
3. [Keypom JS SDK](https://github.com/keypom/keypom-js#getting-started)

With this tutorial, you can either create your own script by following along, or view the completed script available in the [Keypom Documentation Examples](https://github.com/keypom/keypom-docs-examples) repo.

### Creating your Project
In this section, you're going to create your project and install the SDK to prepare for the tutorial. If you have a completed script and have installed the SDK, you can skip [forward](simple-drops.md#breaking-down-the-problem).

First, you need to give your project a home.
 
```bash
mkdir my-keypom-project && cd my-keypom-project
```

Next, you'll want to create a default `package.json` file using the following command. You can accept all default values.
```bash
npm init
```

At this point, your project structure should look like this. 
```bash
/my-keypom-project
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
```

If you open `package.json`, you should see this.

<details>
<summary>Default package.json</summary>
<p>

``` bash
{
  "name": "my-keypom-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

</p>
</details>

The next step is to create an empty JavaScript file.
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Mac/Lnx" label="Mac OS/Linux">

```bash
touch simple-keypom.js
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="WNDS" label="Windows">

```bash
fsutil file createnew simple-keypom.js 0
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Finally, the last step is to install the Keypom JS SDK.
```bash
npm install @keypom/core
```

After installing the SDK, your `package.json` file should now look slightly different.

<details>
<summary>package.json after installing the SDK</summary>
<p>

```bash
{
  "name": "my-keypom-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  # highlight-start
  "dependencies": {
    "@keypom/core": "^1.0.0"
  }
  # highlight-end
}
```

</p>
</details>

With these steps complete, your project folder should look like this. 

```bash
/my-keypom-project
â”œâ”€â”€ simple-keypom.js
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json
â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ @keypom/core
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
```

You are now ready to begin creating your drop!

## Breaking Down the Problem

Creating a simple drop is a four step process:  

1) Establish a connection to the NEAR blockchain.  
2) Create a set of access keys where the assets will be stored.  
3) Use the Keypom SDK to create the drop.  
4) Create linkdrops.  

The following skeleton code can be used as a starting point:
``` js
// Each of the two methods to create this drop will have their own unique set of imports

// Imports used in the Keypom SDK method:
const { initKeypom, createDrop, getEnv, formatLinkdropUrl } = require("@keypom/core");
const { UnencryptedFileSystemKeyStore } = require("@near-js/keystores-node");
const { connect, Near } = require("@near-js/wallet-account");
const path = require("path");
const homedir = require("os").homedir();

// Imports used in the NEAR-API-JS method:
const { parseNearAmount } = require("@near-js/utils");
const { KeyPair } = require("@near-js/crypto")
const { Near } = require("@near-js/wallet-account");
const { Account } = require("@near-js/accounts");
const { UnencryptedFileSystemKeyStore } = require("@near-js/keystores-node");
const path = require("path");
const homedir = require("os").homedir();


async function simpleDropKeypom(){
// STEP 1: Initiate a NEAR connection.

// STEP 2: Create a set of access keys 

// STEP 3: Create the drop.

// STEP 4: Create linkdrops
}

simpleDropKeypom()

```

## Getting Started - Connecting to NEAR
The first step to create a Keypom drop is connecting to the NEAR blockchain.

This is done with `NEAR-API-JS` and consists of the following steps:

1) Create a Keystore, which stores your access keys used to sign transactions   
  * select a network, either `testnet` or `mainnet`  
  * choose a location where the keypairs live, either a folder on your local machine, or in-memory      

2) Define a NEAR configuration using the Keystore  
3) Use the configuration to initialize a connection to NEAR  

More information about this process can be found [here](https://docs.near.org/tools/near-api-js/quick-reference#key-store).

:::note
For simplicity, this tutorial will choose a file-based keystore and point to the `~/.near-credentials` folder on your local machine since this is where most of your keys are stored. For more information about KeyStores, visit NEAR's [official docs](https://docs.near.org/tools/near-api-js/quick-reference#key-store).

```

---

## Creating the Simple Drop
Now that the connection to the NEAR blockchain is set up, the next step is to create the Keypairs and the drop using the Keypom SDK.



`initKeypom` initializes the SDK to allow for interactions with the Keypom smart contracts. Without it, none of the other SDK functions would work as expected. If a NEAR connection is not already present, it will initialize a new one for you. More info on the `initKeypom` function can be found [here](../../keypom-sdk/Core/modules.md#initkeypom).

After `initKeypom` is called, the key generation and drop creation can be done. These two tasks are combined into one function, `createDrop`. This function can be either given a set of pre-created keypairs, **or** it can generate them automatically based on the `numKeys` parameter.

:::tip
Recall that the private keys being generated are used to store the assets. These keys are then embedded within a link.

In a Simple Drop, the assest is $NEAR.
:::

To see what the SDK is doing behind the scenes, a `NEAR-API-JS` equivalent NodeJS script has been provided.

:::

---

## Creating Linkdrops
The last step in this process is to create the links themselves so that you can easily distribute the assets to people. This is done by embedding the private key, containing the $NEAR, into the link along with the Keypom contract ID.  

With the Keypom SDK, this is all neatly wrapped up in the function [`formatLinkdropUrl`](../../keypom-sdk/Core/modules.md#formatlinkdropurl). You just need to provide the base URL format and the private key you wish to embed.

```js reference
https://github.com/keypom/keypom-docs-examples/blob/8202f0ef88205bfca644ccf5d4d3cfb460f88f15/basic-tutorials/simple-drop/simple-example.js#L47-L53

## Testing
### Running the Script
Here, you'll learn how to run the code that was just covered, and what to expect.

To view the completed code, clone the [Keypom Docs Examples](https://github.com/keypom/keypom-docs-examples) repository and navigate to the `basic-tutorials/simple-drop`.
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/keypom/keypom-docs-examples.git && cd keypom-docs-examples/basic-tutorials/simple-drop
```
From there, you can and open the `simple-example.js` file.

To run the code you just cloned, return to the `keypom-docs-examples` directory and install all the necessary packages. 
```bash
cd .. && cd .. && yarn
```

:::caution
Prior to running these scripts, ensure you replace all instances of `keypom-docs-demo.testnet` in the script with the credentials of your account found in your `~/.near-credentials` folder
:::

From there, you can run this Simple Drop script that was made in this tutorial using the following command:
``` bash
yarn basic:simple:keypom
```
:::note
The SDK script is being tested here; use `yarn basic:simple:naj` to test the `NEAR-API-JS` script instead.
:::
This should return a successful drop creation and console log a Public Key and Linkdrop: 
```bash
