# Introduction
DAOs are a raging topic in crypto. The problem with DAOs, however, is the barrier to entry for users that arenâ€™t familiar with the specific chain theyâ€™re built on top of. Users might not have wallets or understand how to interact with contracts. On the contrary, they might be very well versed or immersed in the DAOâ€™s topics. They shouldnâ€™t be required to create a wallet and learn the onboarding process.

With Keypom, you can create a function call drop with the main purpose of registering users into a DAO. For people that have a wallet, this will act as an easy way of registering them with the click of a link. For users that donâ€™t have a wallet and are unfamiliar with NEAR, they can be onboarded and registered into the DAO with the same click of a link.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create this seamless DAO onboarding.
