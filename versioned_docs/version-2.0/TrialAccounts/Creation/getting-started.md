# Introduction
In the following tutorials, you'll learn how Trial Accounts work behind the scenes and how to create a basic drop that can be used to instantly sign a user into the guest-book app. You'll also learn about the underlying flow for the official Keypom wallet selector plugin and how it's used to create instant sign-in experiences for users.
