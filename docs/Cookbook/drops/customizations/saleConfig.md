# Sale Configurations
This part of the cookbook contains everything related to drops, including creating a drop, password protecting it, and utilizing Keypom arguments.
## Getting Started
For the cookbook, you will need the following installed. 
1. [Node JS](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)  
2. [Keypom JS SDK](https://github.com/keypom/keypom-js#getting-started)


:::info note
These scripts will not run without the proper setup shown in the [introduction page](../../welcome.md#connection-to-near-and-initializing-the-sdk).

### Public Sale Drop
A public sale drop is one where you can sell the access keys from a drop to other users. These keys will all have the same propoerties and can be bought by anyone unless otherwise specified using the `allowlist` and `blocklist`. The maximum number of keys in the drop can be set using `maxNumKeys`.

<TabItem value="SDK" label="Keypom JS SDKðŸ§©">

```js
// Create drop with a maximum of 100 keys that can be added by benji and min but not evil-moon
const { keys, dropId } = await createDrop({
    account: fundingAccount,
    depositPerUseNEAR: 0.1,
    config: {
        sale: {
            maxNumKeys: 100,
            pricePerKeyNEAR: 1
            allowlist: ["benji.testnet", "minqi.testnet"]
            blocklist: ["evil-moon.testnet"]
        }
    }
});

console.log(keys)
```

</TabItem>

### Delete Drop
A drop can be deleted manually at any time using `deleteDrops`. This will refund all unclaimed key balances back to the drop funder's Keypom balance. 

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="SDK" label="Keypom JS SDKðŸ§©">

```js
// Get drops for user
let drops = await getDrops({accountId: "minqi.testnet"});

// Delete the first two by drop object
await deleteDrops({
    drops: [drops[0], drops[1]]
})

// Delete the next two by dropId
await deleteDrops({
    dropIds: [drops[2].drop_id, drops[3].drop_id]
})
```

</TabItem>
