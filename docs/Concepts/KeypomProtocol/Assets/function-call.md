# Function Call Asset

The function call asset is by far Keypom's most powerful asset class. FC assets allow **any** method on **any**
contract to be executed (with some exceptions). In addition, there are a huge variety of customizations and features you can choose from when defining the drop that come on top of the global options. The possibilities are almost endless. State of the art NFT ticketing, lazy minting NFTs, auto registration into DAOs, analytics for marketing at events and much more.

## How does it work?
    
When an a key use containing a Function Call asset is claimed, Keypom will make the predetermined function call. This call works as any normal function call and has a preset receiver, method, and attached deposit but can include user specified arguments, immutable Keypom populated basis-of-truth arguments.  


## Structure

A Function Call Asset is defined by a vector of `MethodData`, which indicates a vector of function calls. Each `MethodData` represents a single function call, meaning that since an FC asset is defined with a vector of `MethodData`, multiple function calls can be made in a single key use. 

The `MethodData` object outlines the following:

* `receiver_id`: The contract on the receiving end of the function call.
* `method_name`: The desired method to be called.
* `args`: Arguments to be included in the function call, JSON stringified. 
* `attached_deposit`: Amount of yoctoNEAR to attach to the function call.
* `attached_gas`: Amount of gas for this method
* `keypom_args`: Immutable Keypom populated basis-of-truth arguments, you specify the location and Keypom will inject certain values into these JSON locations within `args`. These cannot be spoofed, for more info see [below](#keypom-arguments)
* `receiver_to_claimer`: Boolean that allows the claimer to become the receiver
* `user_args_rule`: Rules outlining the behaviour of user inputs and predefined `args` when claiming.

## Execution

For **every Function Call Asset**, you can specify a *vector* of `MethodData` which allows you to execute multiple function calls for each asset. These calls are scheduled 1 by 1 using a simple for loop. This means that most of the time, the function calls will be executed in the order specified in the vector but it is not *guaranteed*.

## Injecting Keypom Arguments
Prior to calling the function defined in each `MethodData`, the Keypom contract will **automatically** modify the outgoing arguments according to the defined `keypom_args`. 

For example, if the `account_id_field` is set to `"claiming_account"`, then Keypom will inject the claiming account's IDs into the `claiming_account` field in the args. In addition, arguments can be injected into nested fields by using object dot notation; `funder_id_field: "creator.account_id"` will inject the drop funder's account ID into the `creator` object under the field `account_id`. If specified fields do not exist, Keypom will create them. 

When a key is used and a function is called, an data structure is **automatically** attached to the arguments, known as the `keypom_args`. It contains the information that the drop creator specified in the `MethodData.keypom_args`. 

```rust reference
https://github.com/keypom/keypom/blob/8f9f8df397cb8cabbda30d1ddffdcddc4a733274/contract/src/assets/function_call/models.rs#L32-L45
```


This additional data structure allows receiving contracts to protect themselves from malicious calls by ensuring that critical pieces of information are correct. For example, if a contract knows that `claiming_account_id` should be automatically injected and only wants to work with drops from a particular funder `moon.near`, they can check the `keypom_args`. 

To ensure that `claiming_account_id` is being injected by Keypom rather than hardcoded, the receiving contract can check that `keypom_args.account_id_field` is set to `claiming_account_id`.

To make sure that all claims come from a drop funded by `moon.near`, the drop can inject the funder's account ID using `keypom_args` into any arbitrary field such as `drop_funder`. The receiver contract can then check the value `drop_funder` is `moon.near`, **and** check that `keypom_args.funder_id_field` is set to `drop_funder`. 

:::info
The receiver contract's validation of injected arguments per the examples given above looks like this

```rust
#[payable]
pub fn myFunction(&mut self, mint_id: String, claiming_account_id: String, drop_funder: data, keypomArgs: keypom_args) -> Promise {
        // Ensure arguments are correct if predecessor is Keypom
        if(env::predecessor_account_id() == "v3.keypom.near"){
            //Ensure claiming_account_id was not hardcoded
            assert!(keypomArgs.account_id_field == "claiming_account_id", "Call must come from valid Keypom drop");

            // Ensure drop_funder is moon.near and not hardcoded
            assert!(drop_funder == "moon.near" && keypomArgs.funder_id_field == "drop_funder", "Call must come from valid Keypom drop");
        }
        ...
}
```

### Motivation
By using these injected arguments as a source-of-truth, you can easily create **both** exclusivity and security in your Keypom experiences.

Let's say there was an exclusive NFT contract that allowed the Keypom contract to mint NFTs as part of an FC drop. Only Keypom
was given access to mint the NFTs so they could be given out as linkdrops. The organizer only wanted links that were part of their
drop to be valid. For this reason, the NFT contract would only mint if Keypom called the `nft_mint` function and there was a field 
`series` passed in and it was equal to the drop ID created by the organizer.

Let's say the owner created an exclusive drop that happened to have a drop ID of 5. They could then go to the NFT contract
and restrict NFTs to only be minted if:
- `series` had a value of 5.
- The Keypom contract was the one calling the function.

In order for this to work, when creating the drop, the owner would need to specify that the `drop_id_field` was set to a value of `series`
such that the drop ID is correctly passed into the function.

The problem with this approach is that the NFT contract has no way of knowing which arguments were sent by the **user** when the drop 
was created as part of the MethodData `args` and which arguments are automatically populated by the Keypom contract. There is nothing 
stopping a malicious user from creating a new drop that has an ID of 6 but hard-coding in the actual arguments that `series` should have 
a value of 5. In this case, the malicious drop would have *no* `drop_id_field` and the NFT contract would have no way of knowing that the 
`series` value is malicious.

This can be prevented if a new field is introduced representing what was automatically injected by the Keypom contract itself. At the
end of the day, Keypom will **always** send correct information to the receiving contracts. If those contracts have a way to know what has
been sent by Keypom and what has been manually set by users, the problem is solved. In the above scenario, the NFT contract would simply add
an assertion that the `keypom_args` had the `account_id_field` set to `Some(series)` meaning that the incoming `series` field was set by Keypom
and not by a malicious user.

## Prohibited Methods

Since all function calls will be signed by the Keypom contract, there are a few restrictions in place to avoid malicious behaviors.
To avoid users from stealing registered assets from other assets, the following methods cannot be called via FC assets:

```rust reference
https://github.com/keypom/keypom/blob/7a654aa847f2ce9dedf65755c6a08817eece4666/contract/src/lib.rs#L926-L934
```

In addition, the Keypom contract cannot be the receiver of any function call. This is to avoid people
from calling private methods through FC assets.

## Use Cases

Function call assets are the bread and butter of the Keypom contract. They are the most powerful and complex assets that can currently be created.
With this complexity, there are an almost infinite number of use-cases that arise.

### Proof of Attendance Protocols

A very common use case in the space is what's known as Proof of Attendance. Often times when people go to events, they want a way to prove
that they were there. Some traditional approaches would be to submit your wallet address and you would be sent an NFT or some other form of
proof at a later date. The problem with this is that it has a very high barrier to entry. Not everyone has a wallet.

With Keypom, you can create a function call drop that allows people to onboard onto NEAR if they don't have a wallet or if they do, they can
simply use that. As part of the onboarding / claiming process, they would receive some sort of proof of attendance such as an NFT. This can
be lazy minted on-demand such that storage isn't paid up-front for all the tokens.

At this point, the event organizers or the funder can distribute links to people that attend the event in-person. These links would then be
claimed by users and they would receive the proof of attendance.

### Auto Registration into DAOs

DAOs are a raging topic in crypto. The problem with DAOs, however, is there is a barrier to entry for users that aren't familiar with the
specific chain they're built on top of. Users might not have wallets or understand how to interact with contracts. On the contrary, they
might be very well versed or immersed in the DAO's topics. They shouldn't be required to create a wallet and learn the onboarding process.

With Keypom, you can create a function call drop with the main purpose of registering users into a DAO. For people that have a wallet,
this will act as an easy way of registering them with the click of a link. For users that don't have a wallet and are unfamiliar with
NEAR, they can be onboarded and registered into the DAO with the same click of a link.

### Multisig Contracts

Another amazing use-case for Keypom is allowing multisig contracts to have ZERO barrier to entry. Often times when using a multisig contract,
you will entrust a key to a trusted party. This party might have no idea what NEAR is or how to interact with your contract. With Keypom,
you can create a drop that will allow them to sign their transaction with a click of a link. No NEAR wallet is needed and no knowledge of the
chain is required.

At the end of the day, from the users perspective, they are given a link and when they click it, their portion of the multisig transaction is
signed. The action is only performed on the multisig contract once all links have been clicked. This is an extremely powerful way of doing
accomplishing multisig transactions with zero barrier to entry.

The users don't even need to create a new account. They can simply call `claim` when the link is clicked which will fire the cross-contract call
to the multisig contract and pass in the keypom arguments that will be cross-checked by that contract.

### NFT Ticketing

The problem with current NFT ticketing systems is that they require users to have a wallet. This is a huge barrier to entry for people that
are attending events but don't have wallets. In addition, there is often no proof of attendance for the event as the NFT is burned in order
to get into the event which requires an internet connection.

Keypom aims to solve these problems by having a ticketing system that has the following features.
* Users are not required to have a wallet to enter the event.
* Each ticket is unique and can only be used by one person.
* Attendees are not required to have wifi to gain entry to the event.
* Attendees that did not have a NEAR wallet can get one for free.
* Attendees can choose to receive an NFT proving their attendance at the event. This is commonly known as a [POAP](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/proof-of-attendance-protocol-poap).

In addition, some way to provide analytics to event organizers that contains information such as links that were:
- Given out but not clicked at all.
- Clicked but not attended.
- Partially claimed indicating the number of people that attended but did not onboard or receive a POAP.
- Fully claimed indicating the number of people that attended and received a POAP.

In order to accomplish this, you can create a drop that has 3 uses per key. These uses would be:
1. Array(`null`)
2. Array(`null`)
3. Array(function call to POAP contract to lazy mint an NFT)

The event organizer would create the links and distribute them to people however they see fit. When a user receives the link, the first
claim is automatically fired. This is a `null` case so nothing happens except for the fact that the key uses are decremented. At this point,
the organizer knows that the user has clicked the link since the uses have been decremented.

The next claim happens **only** when the user is at the door. Keypom would expose a QR code that can only be scanned by the host's phone.
This QR code would appear once the first link is clicked and contains the private key for the link. At the event, they wouldn't need any wifi
to get in as they only need to show the host the QR code. Once the host scans it, the site would ensure that they have exactly 2 out of
the 3 uses left. If they don't, they're not let in. At that point, a use is decremented from the key and the next time they visit the
ticket page (when they have internet), they would be able to claim the final use and be onboarded / receive a POAP.
