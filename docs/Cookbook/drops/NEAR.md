# Simple NEAR Drops
This part of the cookbook contains a quick guide on the simple NEAR drop.
## Getting Started
For the cookbook, you will need the following installed. 
1. [Node JS](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)  
2. [Keypom JS SDK](https://github.com/keypom/keypom-js#getting-started)


:::info note
These scripts will not run without the proper setup shown in the [introduction page](../welcome.md#connection-to-near-and-initializing-the-sdk).

## Creating a Simple Drop
A drop is the fundemental building block of Keypom. It is a collection of access keys that all share the same properties. A simple drop allows you to send $NEAR by sharing those access keys in the form of a linkdrop.

<TabItem value="SDK" label="Keypom JS SDKðŸ§©">

```js
// Creating drop with 2 single use keys
const {keys} = await createDrop({
    account: fundingAccount,
    numKeys: 2,
    depositPerUseNEAR: "0.1",
});

console.log(keys)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::caution
`createDrop` is limited to adding 50 password protected keys or 100 non-protected keys at a time. To add more keys, see the [large drops](#creating-a-large-drop) example below.

## Creating a Large Drop
Adding keys, either using `createDrop` or `addKeys` is limited to 50 password protected or 100 non-protected keys. To bypass this, the drop can be created first and then the keys can be added by looping `addKeys`.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="SDK" label="Keypom JS SDKðŸ§©">

```js
// Creating drop with 0 single use keys
const {dropId} = await createDrop({
    account: fundingAccount,
    depositPerUseNEAR: "0.1",
});

// Adding 200 keys to the drop
for(i = 0, i < 4, i++){
    const {keys} = await addKeys({
        dropId,
        numKeys: 50
    })
    console.log(keys)
}

```

</TabItem>

## Delete Drop
A drop can be deleted manually at any time using `deleteDrops`. This will refund all unclaimed key balances back to the drop funder's Keypom balance. 

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="SDK" label="Keypom JS SDKðŸ§©">

```js
// Get drops for user
let drops = await getDrops({accountId: "minqi.testnet"});

// Delete the first two by drop object
await deleteDrops({
    drops: [drops[0], drops[1]]
})

// Delete the next two by dropId
await deleteDrops({
    dropIds: [drops[2].drop_id, drops[3].drop_id]
})
```

</TabItem>
