# Introduction

Recurring payments are quite a common situation. Letâ€™s say you need to send someone $50 USDC every week. You could create a key with 5 claims that has a throttle_timestamp of 1 week. You would then pre-load maybe the first weekâ€™s deposit of $50 USDC and register 1 use or you could send $500 USDC for the first 10 weeks. At that point, you would simply hand over the key to the user and they can claim once a week.
