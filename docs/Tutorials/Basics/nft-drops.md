# Non Fungible Token Drop
When creating an NFT drop, it is important to ensure that the NFT is minted and belongs to you first. To do this, a simple `functionCall` using the NEAR-API-JS to mint the NFT will suffice. This code is shared between the Keypom-JS-SDK approach and the NEAR-API-JS approach.

We will start with initializing the NEAR connection and then make the function call. We will only be minting 1 NFT in this example.

```

The next step is where we create the drop and transfer the newly minted NFT to the Keypom smart contract. Recall from [NFT drop concepts](/Concepts/Keypom%20Protocol/Github%20Readme/Types%20of%20Drops/nftdrops.md), the funder must transfer the NFT to the Keypom contract in order for the NFT to be added to the drop. This is where the two approaches diverge. 

With NEAR-API-JS, this must be done manually. Conversely, with the Keypom-JS SDK, this is done automatically when calling `createDrop`, as seen in the code snipped below.
