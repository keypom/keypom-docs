# Building and Viewing Current Version
Clone repo (for latest WIP version, use min/dev branch), then open a new terminal instance and run the following
1. yarn run build
2. yarn run serve

This should start a new instance in your localhost:3000. If you make any changes to the code and want to view them in your browser, simply re-run the first build command and refresh your browser
