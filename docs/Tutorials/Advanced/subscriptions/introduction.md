# Introduction

Recurring payments are quite a common situation. Letâ€™s say you need to send a contractor $50 USDC every week for 10 weeks. With Web2, you would need to provide a payment method and trust the end user with this sensitive information. 

Using Keypom, you can eliminate this risk by sending them a key with limited funds attached. Instead of exposing your private information, you could create a key with 10 uses, usable once a week. You can then pre-load $500 USDC for the 10 weeks, or $50 USDC for the first week and fund the rest as the work continues. At that point, you would simply hand over the key to the user and they can claim once a week.
