When interacting with the NEAR blockchain, the first thing that you must do is initialize a NEAR connection. This must be manually done with NEAR-API-JS but is done automatically with our Keypom-JS SDK through the use of the `initKeypom` function.

Next, keypairs must be generated. Similar to initializing a NEAR conection, this must be done manually with the NEAR-API-JS but is done automatically through our Keypom-JS SDK when creating a drop.

Finally, to create the drop we use `createDrop` with our Keypom JS SDK or `create_drop` in NEAR-API-JS. 

Note that with NEAR-API-JS, an attached deposit `parseNearAmount("1")` must be added to the `functionCall` in order to fund the drop.
