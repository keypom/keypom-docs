# Introduction

One of the biggest pain-points with Web3 is that users need to fund wallets before they interact with a dApp. In Web2, a user can find value in an application by using it before they go through the messy onboarding process.

**Keypom will allow apps to create links that will automatically sign users into their applications and give them a free trial. **

This can be thought of as giving someone a gift card that only works at your store. This concept is extremely powerful and has been around the Web2 world for a long time. As an example, a casino might give out 10$ vouchers so that people come and play. Once the voucher runs out, people can either leave or top-up their balance and stay longer. The import thing to note with this is that users are only pulling out their credit cards once they‚Äôve actually experienced the casino.

With Keypom‚Äôs limited access accounts, people will be able to interact, spend $NEAR, sign transactions and gather assets with the simple click of a link. Once the free trial is over and users have collected value through interacting with the dApp, they can then choose to upgrade their account and onboard.

Much like the gift-card analogy, users will be locked into only interacting with the dApp specified in the link. They can't take the funds embedded in the ‚Äúvoucher‚Äù and leave. The funds are allocated for only 1 purpose: free trials of a specific application.
