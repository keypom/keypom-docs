# Foundational Concepts
## Drops vs. Keys
At its core, Keypom is revolves around Access Keys and Drops. These two concepts are closely related.

* **Access Key**: A NEAR keypair, this is what each user receives to start their Keypom experience. 
  * Can have assets, such an NFT, FTs, NEAR or FunctionCalls, associated with them.  
  * When a user receives a key and claims it, they will receive those assets.  
* **Drop**: A collection of access keys that all share the same traits - such as assets and configurations. 
  * As a funder, you create the drop and fund all the assets
  * You can add as many keys as you want to the drop, even after its creation.

An easy way to think about it is that you *create a drop* but you *distrubute keys*. 

## What are Assets?
In the Keypom Protocol, assets can be NEAR, Fungible Tokens, Non-Fungible Tokens, or FunctionCalls. Each key in a drop holds the same assets, meaning a user can receive any key from the drop and be guarenteed the same set of assets. Assets are defined **per use** and can be mix-and-matched to craft any experience you want. An example can be seen below:


| **Key Use** | **Assets**                        |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| 1           | NEAR, FunctionCall, Fungible Token|
| 2           | Non-Fungible Token                |
| 3           | Fungible Token, NEAR              |


This means when the user claims their key for the first time, they will receive a FT, some NEAR and call a set of functions. On the second claim, they will receive an NFT while on the third and final claim, they will receive some NEAR and FTs. 

This behaviour is the same accross all the keys in the drop. As the drop funder, you would need to ensure your drop has all the necessary assets to fund all of the keys. For example, if each FT asset represents 1 Go-Team Token and you have 10 keys, you would need to fund your drop with 20 Go-Team Tokens. For more on how to use each asset, see the pages below.

For example, Alice wants to add 10 $NEAR to her Keypom balance. She will do this by calling `addToBalance` and transferring 10 $NEAR to the Keypom contract. Then, if Alice wants to create a drop that costs her 5 $NEAR, she can simply create the drop and Keypom will automatically deduct from her internal Keypom balance rather than needing to transfer 5 $NEAR to the contract.  

Once she has created the drop, she can check her balance using `getUserBalance`, which will return 5 $NEAR. Then, she can withdraw this 5 $NEAR into her NEAR wallet; this will cause her Keypom balance to go down to 0 $NEAR.
