# Keypom v3 Preview
Until now, almost all Keypom drops had to fit into one of the 4 drop types: simple, NFT, FT, or FunctionCall. With v3, Keypom aims to unify these into one drop.

This allows for interopability between all sorts of drop kinds. For example, if you wanted to do an FC drop along with an NFT drop and an FT drop, Keypom V2 would require you to create three unique drops. With v3, these three drops would be combined into one, where you would specify the key use where the receiver would receive X or Y assets.
